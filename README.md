# Computer Vision Virtual Calculator
The Computer Vision Virtual Calculator project utilizes OpenCV to develop a system that can recognize hand gestures and translate them into mathematical operations, allowing users to perform calculations in real-time without the need for physical input devices. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system tracks hand movements, detects gestures representing numbers and mathematical symbols, and processes them to execute corresponding operations. This innovative approach not only offers a hands-free and intuitive user experience but also showcases the practical applications of computer vision in enhancing human-computer interaction.
## PreRequisites
1. Make sure you have install opencv\
   
   **Windows**
   ```shell
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

   **Ubuntu**
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
   ```
3. Install cvzone and mediapipe
   ```shell
   pip install cvzone
   ```

   ```shell
   pip install mediapipe
   ```
4. Make sure the built-in webcam is working properly
5. Run the program
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```
# How to Play
